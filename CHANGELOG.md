## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Security: validated Discord webhook URL pattern in notification preferences to block SSRF via user-controlled webhook URLs; added `follow_redirects=False` as defense-in-depth (AUT-1603).

## [0.3.139] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- CI: added `lib/services/iap_service.dart` to the mobile sync delta-restore list so the mobile-only `IapService` singleton, `IapCatalog`, and `IapProduct` classes survive the shared `lib/` overwrite — fixes `flutter analyze` failures in `license_screen.dart` (AUT-1634).

## [0.3.138] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- CI: switched `publish` and `build-hosted` workflows to `ubuntu-latest` runners while x64 self-hosted runners are offline — unblocks Docker image publishing and multi-arch builds (AUT-1586).
- CI: replaced raw `git` checkout with `actions/checkout` in publish job so it works on fresh GitHub-hosted runners (AUT-1586).
- Fix: IAP service used `billingClientPurchase` (Android-only API unavailable on web), replaced with cross-platform `verificationData.serverVerificationData` (AUT-1586).

## [0.3.137] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- IAP: added Android `com.android.vending.BILLING` permission to `AndroidManifest.xml` so the Play Store recognises the app as IAP-capable and shows in-app purchases on the listing (AUT-1149).
- IAP: added `in_app_purchase` Flutter package to monorepo `pubspec.yaml` and wired native Play Store / App Store purchase flow into the license screen — "Buy from Store" button now initiates a native store purchase via Google Play Billing / StoreKit instead of falling back to Stripe browser checkout (AUT-1149).

## [0.3.136] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- Docs: OBD2 dongle pin guide now maps every firmware GPIO to its physical devkit pin — added a Board label column (silkscreen names: D5, TX2, RX2, VIN…), a full 38-pin DOIT-style board locator diagram with all used pins marked, clone-variant caveat (trust silkscreen, not position), and boot-time strapping notes for D5/D15/D14. New `docs/obd2-dongle/check-pinmap.py` asserts `config.h` pins stay in sync with the doc.

## [0.3.135] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- OBD: the app now connects to the custom AutoBrain OBD2 ESP32 adaptor over Bluetooth from the OBD tab — auto-connect on open (toggle), "Connect & sync now" pulls completed trips off the adaptor and into your logbook (deduped against WiFi uploads), and a codes section shows the fault codes the adaptor reads with one-tap AI diagnostics and a confirmed clear-codes-on-car action. Works over the adaptor's WiFi upload too: it now pushes its code snapshot to the same library.

### Changed
- OBD: Dongle WiFi settings moved out of Settings and into the OBD tab, with a Sync now button that re-pushes saved WiFi credentials to the dongle over BLE.

## [0.3.134] - 2026-08-24

### Removed
- Merch: last merch surface removed from the app + backend — deleted `MerchOrder` model, `app/services/merch.py` webhook recording and `test_merch.py`; billing webhook now handles subscription checkouts only; dropped the `merch_orders` table via new migration. Merch/commerce lives ONLY on autobrainservice.app (product rule PR-2, updated) — supersedes AUT-1567's passive-table compromise (AUT-1571).

## [0.3.133] - 2026-08-24

### Removed
- Merch: in-app merch store removed entirely (Settings → Merch screen, `assets/merch/` bundle, and the `/api/v1/merch/catalog|checkout|orders` endpoints) — merch (incl. the AutoBrain Beanie) is sold ONLY on the autobrainservice.app website merch section, per new product rule PR-2 with a CI guard test. Completed website orders still persist via the Stripe webhook (web + mobile) (AUT-1567).

## [0.3.132] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed
- Merch: AutoBrain Beanie price corrected to A$55 and now ships free (checkout no longer adds the flat shipping rate) — web + mobile (AUT-1559).

## [0.3.131] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- Deploy (hosted): secrets bind-mount sources in `docker-compose.hosted.yml` are parametrized via `${SECRETS_DIR:-/opt/autobrain/secrets}` so hosts with a read-only rootfs can relocate the secrets dir (hosted uses `/data/autobrain/secrets`; see `docs/security.md`) without editing the compose file (AUT-1535).

## [0.3.130] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- Merch store (AUT-1540): in-code catalogue served at `GET /api/v1/merch/catalog` (AutoBrain Beanie, A$25.00 AUD); `POST /api/v1/merch/checkout` opens Stripe Checkout that collects the shipping address + phone with a flat A$9.95 standard-shipping option; completed payment checkouts are recorded as orders via the billing webhook (idempotent by session id) and listed at `GET /api/v1/merch/orders`. Flutter app gains a Settings → Merch store screen (shop + order history) with the beanie artwork bundled.

### Changed
- Billing: find-or-create Stripe customer extracted to `billing.ensure_customer`, now shared by subscription and merch checkouts.

## [0.3.129] - 2026-08-24

### Changed
- App: swapped app logo to the new no-text mark across web icons, iOS AppIcon set (all 25 sizes), Android launcher mipmaps + adaptive foregrounds, and in-app `assets/logo.png`/`app_icon.png` (AUT-1544)

## [0.3.128] - 2026-08-24

### Security
- Docker: stack-config hardening from AUT-1486/AUT-1498 audit (AUT-1533) — credentials moved to `*_FILE` secret files loaded at entrypoint (`docker/lib-load-secrets.sh`), so Postgres/Redis/MinIO/backend/API-key values never appear in container env; Redis/Celery broker now requires auth (`--requirepass`, derived authenticated URLs); 9Router image digest-pinned; compose config check + secret-seed scripts added.

## [0.3.127] - 2026-08-23

### Added
- Shared fuel write access test suite (AUT-1382): new tests verifying shared vehicle fuel entry write permissions and access control.

## [0.3.126] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- App: License screen surfaces the 7-day free trial — "7 days free" chip + trial copy on monthly plan cards, "Start your 7-day free trial" CTA, status-card mention; hidden in IAP mode, on yearly, and once the trial was used (AUT-1411)

## [0.3.125] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- Docker: worker healthcheck detects embedded beat (`-B`) in the celery cmdline so the AUT-601 `celerybeat-schedule` freshness check fires on hosted workers (AUT-1286)

## [0.3.124] - 2026-08-22

### Security
- Backend: billing trial TOCTOU fix — `has_had_trial` claimed in `_apply_subscription` (webhook path, atomic with plan grant); duplicate/racing trial subscriptions end immediately via Stripe `trial_end=now` (AUT-1211)

## [0.3.123] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed
- Frontend: iOS fuel receipt entry — decimal keyboard enabled for Litres, Price, Total so users can type `.` (AUT-1381)

## [0.3.122] - 2026-08-21

### Security
- AB-06: Global per-IP rate limiting middleware + per-route limits (signup 5/min, password-reset 3/min, login 10/min) (AUT-1187)
- AB-07: ILIKE wildcard escape (`%`/`_`) + pagination on admin API user search (AUT-1187)
- AB-09: Backup restore SHA-256 checksum + schema validation, wrapped in DB transaction (AUT-1187)
- AB-14: Asset restore streams to temp file (1 GB cap) instead of 5 GB in-memory load (AUT-1187)
- AB-10: Uniform signup response prevents user enumeration via 409 (AUT-1187)

## [0.3.121] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed
- Deploy: .env and secrets/ excluded from remote tarball — prevents credential leak during deploy (AUT-1188)
- Frontend: nginx runs unprivileged (nginx-unprivileged image, USER nginx, port 8080) — root process eliminated (AUT-1188)
- Hosted & prod stacks: all services hardened — read_only rootfs, cap_drop ALL, tmpfs for /tmp & /var/run (AUT-1188)
- Systemd: backend service runs as docker user, not root (AUT-1188)
- Frontend nginx: server_tokens off added — version disclosure removed (AUT-1188)

## [0.3.120] - 2026-08-21

### Security
- Frontend: default API/WS to https/wss; AndroidManifest adds `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` (F1)
- Android: release build no longer uses debug keystore; signing config via local.properties/CI secrets (F2)
- Android: `android:allowBackup="false"` blocks ADB/cloud backup of secure storage (F3)
- Password reset token delivered via URL fragment (`#token=`) not query string — removed from logs/history (F4)

## [0.3.119] - 2026-08-21

### Security
- Dev compose: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, and AI gateway bound to 127.0.0.1 (AB-INFRA-004/006) — no external exposure in local dev
- Dev compose: Redis requires auth (REDIS_PASSWORD) — open broker eliminated (AB-INFRA-004)
- Dev compose: AI gateway auth mandatory (AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY) — dev opt-out removed, fail-closed everywhere (AB-INFRA-006)

## [0.3.116] - 2026-08-21

### Added
- Embed-on-create smoke test (AUT-1242-C4): new test suite asserting all five
  entity types produce searchable text, the `_valid_embedding` dimension guard
  rejects malformed vectors, and an integration test confirms every entity type
  stores a non-NULL embedding via the `backfill_entity_embedding` path.

## [0.3.115] - 2026-08-21

### Changed
- Hosted stack (AUT-1242): `minio-init` one-shot sidecar removed from
  `docker-compose.hosted.yml` — bucket init (create + force-private) now runs in
  the minio container's own entrypoint before the server blocks, which waits for
  MinIO to accept connections and stays idempotent. One fewer container to run.

## [0.3.114] - 2026-08-20

### Changed
- Merged the market-data scraper into the AI image (AUT-1242-C3): the separate
  `market-data` container is gone. The AI image now runs both this AI gateway
  (`:8001`) and the CarsGuide/BikeGuide market-data API (`:8000`) via an
  entrypoint wrapper, saving a container in the hosted stack.
- Entrypoint now supervises both processes: whichever uvicorn dies first tears
  the container down so Docker restarts it; prod compose wires the scraper's
  `API_KEY` and exposes `:8000` (AUT-1299).
- Aligned `pydantic` pin across `ai/requirements.txt` and `backend/requirements.txt` to
  `pydantic==2.10.4` (AUT-1298). The divergent pin (`2.13.4` in ai/ vs `2.10.4`
